## About The Code

My first attempt in creating the Julia and Mandelbrot set. There is code adapted from a linked source for a more customizable and better-looking approach to the Julia Set. 

The code for Mandelbrot and Julia sets is almost identical, as intended, to show the similarity between the two.

### Built With

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
